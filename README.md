# UWindsor Room Schedule

## < IN PROGRESS >

Shows when UWindsor rooms are in use by classes

## Idea

- Grab a PDF of the current schedule you're looking for
  - You can find timetable PDFs [here](https://www.uwindsor.ca/registrar/541/timetable-information)
- Copy and paste all of the text into a text file
- Use parse.py to extract all of the relevant information
- index.html can be updated to grab the parsed information

Ideally, one would only need to do the parsing steps once per semester.
